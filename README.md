Here is a copy of my vimrc.  It's a work in progress, but this is at least a starting point.

SETUP:
All you need to do is clone this repo into your ~/ directory, rename it to .vimrc to keep it out of the way
and create a symbolic link to the .vim/vimrc file with the following commands:  

```mv vim .vim  ```  
```ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc```

NOTE:
Thanks to Daniel Miessler for the initial configuration (https://github.com/danielmiessler/).  If you are
